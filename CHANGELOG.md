## [v0.2.0] - 2026-08-15

### ⚠️ Breaking Changes
- **Storage Interface Consolidation**: Merged 8 fragmented storage interfaces (`IVectorMemoryStore`, `IBulkMemoryStore`, `IBatchMemoryStore`, `IAtomicMemoryStore`, `IBatchVectorMemoryStore`, `IMemoryHistoryStore`, `IResettableMemoryStore`) into a single cohesive [`IMemoryStore`](src/Mem0Sharp/Contracts/StorageContracts.cs).
- **Embedding Generator Consolidation**: Merged `IBatchEmbeddingGenerator` into [`IEmbeddingGenerator`](src/Mem0Sharp/Contracts/EmbeddingContracts.cs) with default interface fallback.
- **Memory Extractor Consolidation**: Merged `IBehaviorAwareMemoryExtractor` into [`IMemoryExtractor`](src/Mem0Sharp/Contracts/IntelligenceContracts.cs) with `ExtractAsync(messages, options, ct)`.
- **Canonical Service Signatures**: Standardized [`IMemoryService`](src/Mem0Sharp/Contracts/ServiceContracts.cs) and `MemoryService` around canonical options records (`MemoryAddOptions`, `MemorySearchOptions`, `MemoryPageOptions`, `MemoryUpdate`).

### Added
- **SIMD Hardware Acceleration**: Integrated `System.Numerics.Tensors` across vector cosine similarity (`TensorPrimitives.CosineSimilarity`), vector normalization (`TensorPrimitives.Norm`), and vector scaling (`TensorPrimitives.Divide`).
- **Native Qdrant REST Search**: Implemented native REST vector search via `POST collections/{name}/points/search` and `POST collections/{name}/points/search/batch` with payload filter translation.
- **SQLite SQL Pushdown**: Pushed down `user_id`, `agent_id`, `run_id`, `scope`, `behavior`, `memory_type`, and `expires_at` filters directly into parameterized SQL `WHERE` clauses, streaming records via `IAsyncEnumerable<Memory>`.
- **PostgreSQL Graph Store Query Pushdown**: Term pattern matching for graph boost calculations pushed down to database index scans with `ILIKE ANY($1)` instead of full table scans.
- **Concurrent LLM Reranking**: Added bounded concurrent scoring with `Parallel.ForEachAsync` (`MaxDegreeOfParallelism = 8`) in `LlmReranker`.
- **Reverse Index in In-Memory Entity Store**: Added reverse lookup index (`memoryId -> HashSet<string>`) to achieve $O(1)$ memory deletions.
- **Resilient JSON Parsing**: Added markdown fence stripping (```` ```json ````) and JSON array slice extractors in `LlmMemoryExtractor` and `LlmGraphMemoryExtractor`.
- **Strongly-Typed API DTOs**: Migrated `OpenAiCompatibleClient`, `AnthropicClient`, and `OllamaClient` from generic `JsonNode` heap allocations to strongly-typed DTO records and safe base URI combining.

### Optimized
- **BM25 Hybrid Search Complexity**: Precomputed document frequencies reduced BM25 search complexity from $O(D^2 \cdot T)$ to $O(D \cdot T)$ with zero-allocation span tokenization.
- **In-Memory Streaming**: Removed unnecessary `Task.Yield()` state machine overhead in `InMemoryStore.GetAllAsync`.

## [v0.1.7] - 2026-08-15

### Added
- **Long-term memory lifecycle**:
  - Recency-aware retrieval (`ApplyRecencyBias`) during search.
  - Freshness filtering for newer vs. stale facts (`FreshnessWindow`).
  - Stale memory forgetting (`ForgetStaleAsync`) for outdated or superseded facts.
  - Preference consolidation (`ConsolidateAsync`) for preference drift and memory refinement.
- **Enhanced evaluation suite**:
  - Added realistic long-horizon (`realistic-long-haul`) and stale-forgetting (`stale-forget`) benchmark scenarios.
  - Stricter threshold testing and multi-session behavioral memory evaluation.
- Updated documentation and published benchmark results matching verified benchmark runs.

## [v0.1.6] - 2026-08-11

### Added
- **Package split**: Split persistence providers into separate NuGet packages:
  - `Mem0Sharp` (dependency-free core)
  - `Mem0Sharp.PostgreSQL`
  - `Mem0Sharp.SQLite`
- Atomic memory and history persistence for built-in stores.
- Memory provenance with behavior-aware retrieval.
- Factual search excludes associative memories by default.
- Fail-closed entity and graph enrichment.
- Updated OpenAI configuration defaults to `gpt-5.6-luna` (with `text-embedding-3-small` for embeddings).
- External evaluation dataset support and confidence intervals.
- Pinned SQLite runtime dependencies to patched versions.
